You can customize the units, the colors, or even add more unit conversions by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files:

- **HTML**: Modify the dropdowns to add more units or change labels.
- **CSS**: Modify the color scheme or animations to better match your personal style.
- **JavaScript**: Extend the logic to handle additional units or add error handling for invalid input.
